            <h2>Fundamental Skills and Techniques for Badminton Athletes</h2>
            <ul>
            <h2>1. Proper Warm-up</h2>
            <li>A proper warm-up is very important before playing. You need to stretch so your muscles aren’t tight and so you don’t injure yourself.</li>
            <li>Click <a class="vid" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX-CAy0WRY" target="_blank">HERE</a> for a video from <i>Badminton Insight</i> to view an example of a proper workout.</p></li>
            <img class="img" src="../assets/picture.webp" alt="Forehand and Backhand" title="Badminton Grips">
            <h2>2. Racket Grip</h2>
            <li>Players need to familiarize themselves with the forehand and backhand grip on the racket. The pictures are shown below.
            It is an important skill to master because players need to be able to switch their grips on the racket quickly during games.</li>
            <h2>3. Footwork</h2>
            <li>Players need to be able to move around the court easily. To do this, they need to have good footwork.
            This also helps in games more with a combination of speed and agility.</li>
            <h2>4. Service</h2>
            <li>Service is one of the most important skills to master in badminton because it’s the very start of your game. You need to be able to consistently serve the shuttlecock to your opponent's side. It is also very important to be able to receive your opponent's serve. </li>
            <h2>5. Backhand swings</h2>
            <li>Backhand swings are hits that use the backhand grip.</li>
            <h2>6. Forehand swings</h2>
            <li>Forehand swings are hits that use the forehand grip.</li>
            </ul>
