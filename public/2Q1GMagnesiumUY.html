            <h2>1. Proper Warm-up</h2>
            <p>A proper warm-up is very important before playing. You need to stretch so your muscles aren’t tight and so you don’t injure yourself.</p>
            <h2>2. Racket Grip</h2>
            <p>Players need to familiarize themselves with the forehand and backhand grip on the racket. The pictures are shown below.
            It is an important skill to master because players need to be able to switch their grips on the racket quickly during games.</p>
            <h2>3. Footwork</h2>
            <p>Players need to be able to move around the court easily. To do this, they need to have good footwork.
            This also helps in games more with a combination of speed and agility.</p>
            <h2>4. Service</h2>
            <p>Service is one of the most important skills to master in badminton because it’s the very start of your game. You need to be able to consistently serve the shuttlecock to your opponent's side. It is also very important to be able to receive your opponent's serve. </p>
            <h2>5. Backhand swings</h2>
            <p>Backhand swings are hits that use the backhand grip.</p>
            <h2>6. Forehand swings</h2>
            <p>Forehand swings are hits that use the forehand grip.</p>
            <h2>7. Drop Shots</h2>
            <p>The dropshot is executed by just pushing the shuttlecock just to drop over the net. It is best to execute this shot when the opponent is at the back or do the drop on the opposite side of where your opponent is.</p>
            <h2>8. Drive</h2>
            <p>A drive shot is executed from the middle of the court. It is a powerful and flat shot that forces your opponent to do a clear shot if executed correctly.</p> 
            <h2>9. Clear</h2>
            <p>There are two kinds of clear shots, backhand and forehand. This shot is used to hit the shuttlecock to the very back but still inside the borders. It is usually used when you need time, so you hit the shuttlecock far away so your opponent has to go to the very back.</p>
            <h2>10. Smash</h2>
            <p>A smash is considered one of the most powerful shots in badminton. It is a strong shot directly aimed for the ground making it hard for your opponent to receive.</p>
